# PyLearning Journey

Welcome to my **PyLearning Journey** repository! This repository contains my Python learning journey as I follow an Udemy course. All code and exercises are developed and executed using Google Colab and regular Python `.py` files.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Google Colab notebooks with my learning progress and exercises.
- `scripts/`: Contains standalone Python `.py` files for various exercises and projects.


### Running Notebooks

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Open any `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
